## About

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It utilizes the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) as well as the [Udio API](https://udioapi.pro) to create funny roasts out of images.
